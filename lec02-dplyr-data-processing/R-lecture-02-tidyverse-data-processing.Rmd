# Selecting columns

- Specific columns in a data set can be chosen using `dplyr::select`

  - As with `mutate`, first argument is a data set, subsequent arguments are expressions, and the result is a new data set
  
- Offers a variety of ways to choose multiple columns at once, making it a significant improvement on approaches available in base R.


---


# Selecting columns

### By name

```{r}
# Create a data set of discharge- and patient-specific identifiers.
disch_identifiers <- select(core1p, KEY, VisitLink, DaysToEvent, LOS)
colnames(disch_identifiers)
```


---


# Selecting columns

### By a character vector

```{r}
# Create a data set containing the variables related to patient
# residence.
vars_patient_residence <- c(
  "PSTATE", "PSTCO", "PSTCO2", "PSTCO_GEO", "ZIP")
disch_patient_residence <- select(
  core1p, all_of(vars_patient_residence))
colnames(disch_patient_residence)
```


---


# Selecting columns

### By a common prefix

```{r}
# Create a data set consisting of the procedure code columns.
disch_prcodes <- select(core1p, starts_with("I10_PR"))
colnames(disch_prcodes)
```


---


# Selecting columns

### By a common suffix

```{r}
# Select all of the "from source" columns (i.e., columns whose values
# were not edited by HCUP).
disch_from_source <- select(core1p, ends_with("_X"))
colnames(disch_from_source)
```


---


# Selecting columns

### By a common sequence of characters somewhere in the names

```{r}
# Select all columns with income-related information.
disch_income <- select(core1p, contains("INC"))
colnames(disch_income)
```


---


# Selecting columns

### By sequence based on column order

- Inspired by shorthand for sequence of integers: `1:3` $\equiv$ `c(1,2,3)`

```{r}
# Select `VisitLink` and `DSHOSPID` and everything in between.
disch_VisitLink_to_DSHOSPID <- select(core1p, VisitLink:DSHOSPID)
colnames(disch_VisitLink_to_DSHOSPID)
```


---


- Using column positions can be risky
- Suppose we want to select all diagnosis code columns

```{r include = FALSE}
options(width = 120)
```

```{r}
disch_all_dx_codes_wrong <- select(
  core1p, I10_DX_Admitting:I10_DX34, I10_ECAUSE1:I10_ECAUSE6)
colnames(disch_all_dx_codes_wrong)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
options(width = 70)
```


---


# Selecting columns

### By sequence based on column order

- Different years of data have different numbers of diagnosis codes
- 1% sample data set was formed by stacking the annual CORE files
  - `I10_DX_Admitting`&ndash;`I10_DX31` contiguous but not with `I10_DX32`&ndash;`I10_DX34`
  
- In general, selection based on column names is more reliable

--

- Regardless, always check your selection with `str`, `colnames`, or by printing or `View`ing the resulting data set


---


# Selecting columns

### By sequence based on column order

```{r}
disch_all_dx_codes_right <- select(
  core1p, starts_with("I10_DX"), starts_with("I10_ECAUSE"))
colnames(disch_all_dx_codes_right)
```


---


# Selecting columns

### By negation

- i.e., "select everything except..."

```{r}
# Create a data set excluding all columns related to diagnosis and
# procedures codes, including POA codes and the `PRDAY`n fields.
disch_no_dx_or_pr_codes <- select(
  core1p,
  !c(
    starts_with("I10_"), starts_with("DXPOA"), starts_with("E_POA"),
    starts_with("PRDAY"))
)
colnames(disch_no_dx_or_pr_codes)
```

- `!` inverts the selection
- Note that `!c(...)` is required


---


# Subsetting rows

- Aside from the column exclusion, `!` is often used in three cases:

1. Select nonmissing values
  - `!is.na(x)`
  
2. Checking for non-equality
  - `x != 0`
  
3. Select values *not in* a specific set of values
  - `!(x %in% y)`
  - Can be difficult to read if part of complex expression, so may want to use special 'not in' operator `x %nin% y`; this requires loading Hmisc with `library(Hmisc)`


---


# Subsetting rows

- Relies on expressions that return `TRUE` or `FALSE`

--

- Used several of these types of expressions when defining variables in previous lecture:

  - `is.na(LOS)`
  - `AGE >= 18`
  - `PAY1 == 1`
  - `TRAN_IN %in% c(1, 2)`
  
  
---


# Subsetting rows

- Tidyverse subsetting uses `filter`

- Can combine multiple expressions or write them as separate arguments

  - The arguments are implicitly combined using `&`

```{r}
disch_adults1 <- filter(core1p, !is.na(AGE) & AGE >= 18)
disch_adults2 <- filter(core1p, !is.na(AGE), AGE >= 18)
```

--

- Expressions connected by 'or' have to be combined

```{r}
disch_transfer_in_or_out <- filter(
  core1p, TRAN_IN %in% c(1, 2) | TRAN_OUT %in% c(1, 2))
```


---


# Grouping data

- We can tell dplyr we want to process data by a grouping factor using `group_by`

  - Doesn't directly change the data set, just how other functions work
  
--
  
### Summarizing by group

- `group_by` is most often used with `summarise` to compute summary statistics within each group

```{r}
# Create a data set containing the number of discharges for each
# patient.
disch_grouped_by_patient <- group_by(core1p, VisitLink)
p_dischcharge_counts <- summarise(
  disch_grouped_by_patient, dischcharge_count = n())
```

- `group_by` paired with `summarise` changes the level of organization of the data&mdash;here from discharge level to patient level


---


# Summarizing by group


```{r}
disch_grouped_by_patient
```


---


# Summarizing by group


```{r}
p_dischcharge_counts
```


---


# The pipe `%>%` operator

- Many packages in the Tidyverse are designed to work with the pipe operator, `%>%`

--

- Takes the result of the expression on the 'left-hand side' and passes it as the first argument to the expression on the 'right-hand side'.

--

- Useful because each of the tidyverse functions we've looked at so far&mdash;`mutate`, `select`, `filter`, `group_by`, and `summarise`&mdash; all take a data set as their first argument and produce a new data set as output


---


# The pipe `%>%` operator

So we can write

```{r}
disch_identifiers <- select(core1p, KEY, VisitLink, DaysToEvent, LOS)
```

as

```{r}
disch_identifiers <- core1p %>%
  select(KEY, VisitLink, DaysToEvent, LOS)
```

--

- Most useful when needing to 'chain' several commands together but don't want to save intermediate results or write a nested set of function calls


---


Suppose we want the procedure code and procedure day columns for all adults starting in 2016. We could write

```{r}
disch_adults <- filter(core1p, !is.na(AGE), AGE >= 18, YEAR >= 2016)
disch_adults_pra <- select(
  disch_adults,
  KEY, VisitLink, DaysToEvent, LOS, starts_with("I0_PR"),
  starts_with("PRDAY"))
```

or

```{r}
disch_adults_prb <-
  select(
    filter(
      core1p,
      !is.na(AGE), AGE >= 18, YEAR >= 2016
    ),
    KEY, VisitLink, DaysToEvent, LOS, starts_with("I0_PR"),
    starts_with("PRDAY")
  )
```


---


# The pipe `%>%` operator

But a bit clearer would be

```{r}
disch_adults_prc <- core1p %>%
  filter(!is.na(AGE), AGE >= 18, YEAR >= 2016) %>%
  select(
    KEY, VisitLink, DaysToEvent, LOS, starts_with("I0_PR"),
    starts_with("PRDAY")
  )
```
